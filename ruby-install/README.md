# Ruby & rbenv Installation

There is currently two parts to get this to work.

`install` & `rbenv-install`

The first part that needs to be ran is `install`. This will install the
requirements needed to complete the installation with `rbenv-install`.

# Disclaimer

This is currently **ONLY** set to work with zsh.
